# Otp

Code from this session: https://craft-conf.com/speaker/ClaudioOrtolina

## Goal

> Claudio explores Elixir's concurrent programming by re-creating a minimal version of GenServer, one of the most important constructs from OTP, the concurrent programming framework included in Erlang and Elixir. 

Unfortunately, we got nowhere near that, but it was fun anyways.

## Run tests

`mix test`
